üöÄ Getting Started

Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your local machine.
MongoDB Atlas account for the remote database connection.
Stripe account for payment processing (test mode).

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/shirish001/online-furniture-shop.git
cd online-furniture-shop

Install dependencies:
Run the following command to install all the required Node.js packages:
npm install

Set up the .env file:
Create a .env file in the root of your project directory. This file will store your environment variables.

Add the following values to your .env file:
MONGODB_URI= "your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string_here"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY= "your_stripe_secret_key_here"

You can obtain your MongoDB Atlas connection string from the MongoDB Atlas dashboard. Navigate to your cluster, click "Connect," and select "Connect your application" to copy the connection string.

You can get your Stripe secret key from the Stripe Dashboard. Be sure to use the test mode key for development.

Run the application:

Once the dependencies are installed and the .env file is set up, you can start the application:
npm start

Access the application:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

üîë Default User Role
By default, a newly created user will be assigned the customer role.
To assign someone as an administrator, you will need to manually update the isAdmin field in the user's document in MongoDB. This can be done either by using the MongoDB shell or MongoDB Compass.
Using the MongoDB Shell:
To make a user an administrator, run the following command in the MongoDB shell after connecting to your Atlas database:

db.users.updateOne(
{ email: "user@example.com" }, // Change this to the user's email or unique identifier
{ $set: { isAdmin: true } }
);
Alternatively, directly add the isAdmin field in the document in atlas to update the user authorization.

üí° Notes:
The default connection port is 3000, so the application will be available at http://localhost:3000 when running locally.
